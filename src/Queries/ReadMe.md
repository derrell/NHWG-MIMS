This is a collections of JavaScript queries and other scripts useful for probing the Monogo Wing database.
There are various scripts.  The .js scripts are meant to be pasted into the Studio 3T IntelliShell buffer for execution.
You may need to change some parameters since Mongo JS doesn't yet have a mechanism for handling user input.  There are
fragments and whole scripts, bits and pieces I find useful.

There's probably a lot of garbage in here but it may useful as learning material for Pymongo or Mongo JS programming, 
as an introduction to MongoDB.
