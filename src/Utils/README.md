This directory contains some helpful utilities for various painful jobs in
Workspace that I needed to do.  They can also be and aid to understanding
how shared drives, and accounts are seen in Google Workspace.

Please read and understand the scripts before diving in.  You will definitely
wish to make changes to suit your Workspace world.

* getGAM - Pull and install a recent version of GAM
* makeDriveFolders - Build a folder tree for a single unit shared drive
* passwd_reset - Do a Workspace password reset and notify the user.
* qdaccount - A somewhat quick ad hoc script to make a new Workspace user
* Squadron_Drive_Folders_Create - Create unit shared drive folders, similar to *makeDriveFolders*. May be safer.
* unitRoleAccts - Helps create unit level role accounts for commanders and deputies, etc
* unitSharedDriveFolderStruct.csv - Folder hierarchy used by *makeDriveFolders*
